# Predictive Housing Price Analysis and Optimization

* **Data Exploration and Analysis:** Conducted thorough data exploration by examining summary statistics, identifying missing values, and investigating the relationships between various features and the target variable (SalePrice).

* **Model Selection and Hyperparameter Tuning:** Employed a variety of regression models, including Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost, and performed hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance. The best models were identified based on the root mean square error (RMSE).

* **Feature Engineering:** Engineered new features, such as property age, total living area, and total bathrooms, to improve model accuracy and capture valuable insights into housing prices. Categorical variables were appropriately encoded for modeling.

* **Principal Component Analysis (PCA):** Applied PCA for dimensionality reduction to reduce multicollinearity and enhance the efficiency of regression models while maintaining predictive performance.

* **Ensemble Modeling:** Employed ensemble techniques by combining predictions from different models (Random Forest, XGBoost, and a Multilayer Perceptron Regressor) to create a more robust and accurate final prediction.
